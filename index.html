Biography

I am currently a tenure-track Associate Professor in the John Hopcroft Center (JHC) for Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). From September 2018 to August 2021, I was an assistant professor in JHC at SJTU. From June 2017 to June 2018, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), advised by Prof. R. Srikant and Prof. Klara Nahrstedt. I received my PhD degree from the Department of Computer Science of UIUC in May 2017, advised by Prof. Klara Nahrstedt. Before that, I received my Bachelor degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering of SJTU in July 2012. I was elected “国家海外高层次青年人才计划” in 2020.

Research Interests

I am broadly interested in theoretical modeling and analysis, system implementation, and data-driven researches in the intersection of AI, machine learning, and networks and systems. My interested research areas include intelligent internet of things, urban computing, smart transportation, crowd sensing, mobile and ubiquitous computing, reinforcement learning in networks and systems, cloud and edge computing, game theory and network economics, etc.

Openings

For any student who is interested in working with me on theoretical modeling, algorithm design and analysis, system implementation, and data analysis in the aforementioned (but not limited to those) areas, please feel free to shoot me an email. Students at all levels, both undergraduate and graduate students, are welcomed!
